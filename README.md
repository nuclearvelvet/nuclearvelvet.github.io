# Hello
I am Nuclear Velvet and I am learning to code. This will be where I keep notes and related information
```markdown
1. # is the same as <h1> in HTML
  - Item adding an additional # results in <h2>, add another and get <h3>, and so on
2. Add images through the format of ![Alt Text](url)
  - Currently unable to make this work, unaware of where to find the url of an image.
3. As I am quite tired now, I will stop here for today.
